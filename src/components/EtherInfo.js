                  Normally, interacting with a smart contract requires ether to pay gas fees. However, SimpleID makes it easy for developers to make transactions 
                  free as youâ€™ll see when you unlock each section. That said, SimpleID enables in-app cryptocurrency purchases. You can experiment with that to the right.
