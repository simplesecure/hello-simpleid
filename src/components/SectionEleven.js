        <p><strong>Security & Convenience</strong></p>
        <p>
          The whole idea behind SimpleID is to give users access to blockchain and decentralization in the easiest way possible. However, that doesn’t mean compromising on security. It also doesn’t mean fully compromising on decentralization. 
          We consider our service “centralized convenience” for a decentralized web.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure we, as a custodial solution, maintain that convenience without losing sight of the significant security concerns that come with being a custodial solution, we have built solutions using the best security practices available 
          and we have partners with others to ensure our security is always top of mind. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The overall architecture of the SimpleID solution is designed to minimize the surface area of vulnerabilities. It is also designed to be flexible in adding modules, removing modules, and changing the security properties. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As we continue to build, we plan to improve upon the security of the custodial model we’ve set forth by offering enterprises self-hosted options in which security can be as locked down as an on-premise implementation behind a company 
          firewall. We also plan to implement hardware security modules  <a href="#footnote-16">[16]</a> for our hosted service. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t believe that blockchain and p2p applications need to force users into an overly complex new world. Instead, we believe that by balancing out the convenience with the decentralization needed, we can finally show the world the 
          power blockchain has to offer.
