        Many people cannot manage the passwords they use for websites everyday. So much so that many use the same password across multiple sites. Despite this well-documented fact <a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a>, Web 3.0 is under the impression that users will be able to manage a 12- or 24-word phrase (seed phrase). Web 3.0, currently, believes that these people may, in fact, manage multiple sets of these seed phrases.

        <p>
        Rather than asking users to do this, SimpleID has built tools that let enterprises and individual developers eliminate not just the need to manage those seed phrases but to eliminate passwords as well. Moving to a more convenient authentication model is something we believe should be a core focus of Web 3.0. Web 3.0 needs to provide solutions that are better than the web that precedes it, and passwordless solutions are clearly better for the user experience.

        But it doesn’t end there, of course. Users have varying levels of technical understanding. For those that understand the need to manage their private keys, SimpleID lets developers easily enable this. For users that worry about the centralization of data tied to their identity and financial info, SimpleID has a multi-key solution that ensures SimpleID, as the developer tool service, can never access a user’s private key without implicit action by the user.

        SimpleID believes that for enterprises and individual developers to see widespread adoption of blockchain and p2p technology, they must meet users where the users are.
