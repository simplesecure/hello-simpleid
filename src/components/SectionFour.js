        <p><strong>Ending the Convenience Tradeoff</strong></p>
        <p>
        To use Web 3.0 today, you have to agree to trade convenience for data ownership and control. That’s how the system has been built thus far. But there is a different way to approach Web 3.0. It is possible to build a hybrid model in which end-users get control of their data without needing to trade the convenience they’ve grown accustomed to on the web. In building off this model, these users can finally be introduced to some of the real benefits of Web 3.0 that they never got to experience because of the burden associated with just getting started.

        <p>
        Custodial is a dirty word in Web 3.0, but we’ve already seen how Web 3.0 as a whole has made mistakes in their approach. It’s time to reconsider custodial solutions and find a way to make them as user-centric as possible. What we do not want to see is a repeat of Web 2.0 where walled gardens were built and users lost complete control of the web. Knowing the end goal makes find the solution so much easier, and that’s what SimpleID is building for. We are building for the people, and that means meeting them where they are.
